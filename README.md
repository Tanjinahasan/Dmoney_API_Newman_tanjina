# Dmoney_API_Newman_tanjina
# About The Project:
This is a demo fintech API, which can create user, make transaction, search user, update users. Here I have chained multiple API's by using postman and generate a report using Newman.

# Scenario:
1.Admin creates an agent and random 2 customers. Admin email: admin@roadtocareer.net/ Pass: 1234

2.Deposit some money from SYSTEM account to the agent. System account: SYSTEM (range 10 tk to 10000 tk)

3.Agent deposit to any of 1 customer

4.Check agent balance

5.Then withdraw any amount by the customer from the agent (range 10 tk to 10000 tk)

6.Then the customer checks balance

7.Then send money to the other customer

8.Then from the another customer payment to this merchant: 01686606905

9.Then the second customer will check both balance and statement

10.Then the merchant will check his own balance
